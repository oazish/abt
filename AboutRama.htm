                  FOR RAMA-DR. FREDERICK LENZ</h1> </font></b></div>
                <p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4"><h2>First and foremost, Rama
                  was an Enlightened Buddhist and Siddha master whose life, and 
                  whose ability to help his students, transcended the limits of 
                  his earthly incarnation.</h2> Rama was born Frederick Lenz III on
                  February 9, 1950 in San Diego, California, USA. Rama had had 
                  many high past lives as an Enlightened master in Tibet, India, 
                  Europe, and dating all the way back to Atlantis. This was his 
                  first incarnation in the modern Western world-Rama has said 
                  that he needed to incarnate in the West this time because the 
                  Chinese invasion of Tibet made it impossible to do so in the 
                  East this time.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4"><h2>Rama was raised in an ordinary</h2>
                  American family, primarily on the East Coast where his family 
                  moved (from San Diego) when he was about two years old. He was 
                  very close to his mother-whom he was later to say was one of 
                  the primary influences on his life-but she died tragically when 
                  Rama was fourteen years old. From that point onward, he was 
                  raised by his uncle and father, both police officers in the 
                  Stamford, Connecticut police department. Rama's family was partly 
                  Irish, and he was later to observe that at point in time, the 
                  police force was one of the few career options to Irish-Americans. 
                  (His father would later go on to become mayor of Stamford.) 
                  Another option was the priesthood, and so the possibility of 
                  a spiritual life-albeit in a much different form than what eventually 
                  transpired-was imprinted early into Rama's mind.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">At the same time as Rama 
                  went through the usual rites of passage of a growing young man, 
                  however, his Enlightenment from past lives began to reassert 
                  itself. Rama indicated that it was pretty much inevitable, given 
                  that he had been Enlightened in so many past lives, that he 
                  would become Enlightened again in this life. He began to experience 
                  Samadhi-a high state of consciousness marked by the absence, 
                  at least temporarily, of thought-at an early age. To put some 
                  structure on his experiences, he began to seek out Eastern spiritual 
                  teachers. By the age of twenty, Rama was himself beginning to 
                  teach meditation to others, and was studying formally with a 
                  teacher based on Long Island.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">Rama enrolled in the University 
                  of Connecticut, and performed sufficiently well to be awarded 
                  the top graduate fellowship available in the entire State University 
                  of New York system. He earned his Ph.D. in English from the 
                  SUNY campus at Stony Brook in 1978, writing his dissertation 
                  on the work of American poet Theodore Roethke. At the same time, 
                  Rama also wrote a book entitled Lifetimes: True Accounts of 
                  Reincarnation. Rama was thus on a path to become a teacher on 
                  two different tracks: as a traditional university professor, 
                  and as a teacher of Enlightenment and mysticism through his 
                  books and his direct experience of Samadhi.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">Rama taught for a little 
                  while at the New School in New York, but as he approached his 
                  Saturn return, his past life Enlightenment began to kick in 
                  much more powerfully, and the focus became ever stronger on 
                  the esoteric aspects of his teachings. In 1979, Rama moved, 
                  along with a number of his closer meditation students, back 
                  to San Diego. By this point, Rama was known as 'Atmananda'-he 
                  was no longer referred to primarily by his birth name, but had 
                  not yet taken the name of Rama. It was in San Diego that Atmananda/Rama's 
                  Enlightenment really began to kick in. Atmananda and several 
                  of his closer students rented a house in San Diego, and they 
                  also began to teach to others living in the areas. Those who 
                  studied with Atmananda at the time recall sitting up with him 
                  often most of the night, watching his body dissolve into Eternity 
                  and dissolving with him. Atmananda was letting go of the structures 
                  that had led him to that point in the incarnation, and his Enlightenment 
                  was taking over. Rama subsequently observed that this was not 
                  necessarily an easy part of his life, because he had no one 
                  really to guide him through the experience.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">Atmananda also began leading 
                  students on desert excursions in the surrounding deserts near 
                  San Diego. Atmananda indicated that by meditating in the desert 
                  one can find some of the highest energy to be found in the USA, 
                  and one can make major transitions in one's life. It was on 
                  one such trip that Atmananda saw that the Universe wanted him 
                  to become known as Rama, and this was the name he used-sometimes 
                  in the longer form 'Zen Master Rama'-for the rest of his incarnation. 
                  Rama indicated that this did not mean that he was the incarnation 
                  of the historical Rama from the Ramayana, but rather both he 
                  and the historical Rama were manifestations of the warrior aspect 
                  of Enlightenment.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">In the early 1980's, Rama 
                  moved his teachings primarily to Los Angeles-he also had a center 
                  in San Francisco for awhile-and he began to teach, through an 
                  organization called Lakshmi Seminars, to a larger number of 
                  students. Most came because of the pure magic that Rama was 
                  able to impart-both the &quot;Light shows&quot; in the seminars 
                  and on the desert excursions, but even more importantly through 
                  the magical ways that they were able to make changes in their 
                  own lives. Rama rented a home owned by Goldie Hawn for a time, 
                  and taught to over a thousand active, formal students including 
                  movie stars and people from all walks of life. Through his public 
                  lectures, Rama probably taught introductory meditation to hundreds 
                  of thousands of people during this period-he kept up a schedule 
                  of public meditations that was quite grueling. During this time, 
                  Rama also put out his second major book-The Last Incarnation-about 
                  his students' experiences studying with him--as well as a number 
                  of other, shorter, books.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">Rama was demanding on himself, 
                  and he was also, by his own admission, demanding on his students. 
                  By this time period he began to notice that a lot of his students 
                  were not strong in the &quot;first attention&quot; or the &quot;tonal&quot;-that 
                  is, they were focused on trying to achieve Enlightenment at 
                  the expense of their material success. Rama saw that a student's 
                  ability to achieve Enlightenment depended, in part, on their 
                  ability to have their physical life together. (It doesn't necessarily 
                  work the other way: someone who is rich isn't necessarily going 
                  to be especially spiritual. But someone who is homeless doesn't 
                  have an environment in which they can meditate effectively). 
                  Rama saw, therefore, that he was going to have to be a bit more 
                  selective about whom he would admit as students. He demanded 
                  more of his students, and he conducted what were affectionately 
                  called &quot;purges&quot; where he asked large numbers of students 
                  to leave the program. Needless to say, those who were &quot;purged&quot; 
                  were first given an empowerment to help them with their lives 
                  outside the program.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">Rama moved his &quot;intermediate&quot; 
                  students to Palo Alto in the fall of 1987, and at that point 
                  he began a new cycle in his teaching. For the next few years, 
                  he pretty much eliminated his public lectures and focused on 
                  intensively teaching a smaller number of students. He was, by 
                  most accounts, pretty tough with these students, really expecting 
                  them to get their lives and especially their careers in shape. 
                  Rama was criticized at the time for rising tuitions-his seminars, 
                  which at one point had been offered for free or at nominal cost, 
                  were definitely becoming more costly. Yet he also got results, 
                  as his students were making amazing progress in their careers, 
                  moving from minimum wage jobs to high paying positions as consultants 
                  or corporate leaders. During the late 1980's, Rama moved this 
                  group of students around a fair bit as business conditions changed, 
                  settling in Washington DC, Boston, and finally New York. Not 
                  every student necessarily made every move that Rama recommended, 
                  but most of them did end up in New York by the early 1990's.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">By this point, Rama saw 
                  two things: one, that the energies of the world were changing 
                  with the end of the Cold War and the fall of the Soviet Union, 
                  and two, that his students had reached a point where they were 
                  ready to begin teaching themselves. Indeed, he felt that sometimes 
                  the only way you learn something is by teaching it yourself, 
                  and he thought that his students had better start teaching themselves 
                  if they were ever to really learn anything. So in late 1991, 
                  Rama sent his students out to teach meditation to new students 
                  in six cities throughout the USA-New York, Boston, Philadelphia, 
                  Washington DC, Los Angeles, and San Francisco. His older students, 
                  who had been with Rama for years, were dubbed &quot;ST1s&quot;-&quot;Star 
                  Trek Ones&quot;. The new students, who were mentored by the 
                  ST1s and had to be 29 or under, were called &quot;ST2s&quot;. 
                  At this point, the focus changed back somewhat to the direct 
                  study of Enlightenment and meditation-during the late 1980's 
                  career had very much been the dominant theme. Magic was definitely 
                  back in style around Rama-he conducted new desert excursions, 
                  and the ST1s helped the ST2s to make the same transitions in 
                  their personal and spiritual lives that they themselves had 
                  made over the years. The group moved once again, in 1993, with 
                  the ST1s moving to Chicago and the ST2s moving to New York. 
                  During this period, Rama also wrote two new books: Snowboarding 
                  to Nirvana and Surfing the Himalayas which were aimed especially 
                  at the ST2s. Rama also had a number of very high vibe rave parties 
                  at upscale locations in Manhattan. These parties were not simply 
                  parties-they were opportunities for people to permanently shift 
                  their assemblage points and make significant changes in their 
                  lives.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">At this point, Rama decided 
                  that he wanted to start a number of software companies with 
                  his students, to work more closely with them and to help everyone 
                  to move forward in the growing software industry. He founded 
                  a number of software companies in 1994 and began to put more 
                  and more of his energies into the software industry.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">On a somewhat different 
                  track, for most of this whole time period, Rama had worked closely 
                  with a band called Zazen, composed of three of his students. 
                  Rama worked very closely with Zazen to help them create music 
                  that his students could meditate to and go into higher states 
                  of consciousness. It was often said that the members of Zazen 
                  were Rama's closest students. Meditation to music is not strictly 
                  necessary, but it can go a long way, especially for a beginning 
                  student, to blocking out negative energies of the world and 
                  assisting in meditation. Some of the albums produced during 
                  this period included Enlightenment, Canyons of Light, Samadhi, 
                  Samurai, Retrograde Planet, Cayman Blue and Zen Master. All 
                  were impeccable-Rama used to say that the two ways to find him 
                  were either in his music or in the desert.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">Shortly after founding his 
                  software companies, however, Rama's health began to fail. It 
                  is said that an Enlightened teacher only has so long to teach 
                  before their cell structures begin to break down-they do not 
                  really belong in the physical anymore, so can retain their physical 
                  form for only so long. Rama worked very hard on his companies-in 
                  fact, probably he worked harder than on anything else he'd ever 
                  worked, and this likely contributed to his physical decline-and 
                  he achieved some significant successes, as well as the inevitable 
                  setbacks any entrepreneur faces. By early 1997, Rama realized 
                  that his time in the physical was ending-the death of his favorite 
                  Scottie dog Vayu had been a setback for him too. He continued 
                  to push himself very hard on his work, but he also called his 
                  students together for a number of farewell parties in the Caribbean, 
                  culminating in the Kalachakra empowerment in late 1997, to which 
                  all of his former students were invited. Rama passed away around 
                  April 12, 1998, and he has said that he will not be incarnating 
                  again on this earth.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">Rama's teachings are continued 
                  to this day through the efforts of his students. Each of Rama's 
                  students represents their own unique strand of Rama's luminosity, 
                  so while they each teach in a unique manner, together they keep 
                  Enlightenment alive on the Earth. Many of his students are themselves 
                  going into Samadhi and reaching the earlier stages of Enlightenment 
                  at this point, and they are empowering growing numbers of people 
                  to do the same.</font></p>
