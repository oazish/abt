                This is the 'Wheel of Time' tanka.  RAMA used to periodically
                meditate and do practices in front of it while it was stretched
                out on the floor, so this tanka has RAMA's direct
                empowerment.  According to Dagmola, wife of the head of the Sakya Lineage of Tibetan Buddhism, every monastery has a picture of the Wheel of Life or Dharma close to the entrance.  It displays the 6 Realms, three higher--God, Demi-Gods, and Humans--and three lower--Animal, Hell, and Hungry Ghosts.  It also displays the Six Cycles of Time.  Dagmola indicated that RAMA's meditation on this tanka probably indicates that he was preparing for his next birth.</font></td>
