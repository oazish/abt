                  Buddhist Temple Website</h1>, otherwise called the &quot;ABT&quot;
                  Website for short. This website was inspired by Dr. Frederick 
                  P. Lenz III, known to his spiritual students as Rama, a teacher 
                  of Buddhism for Westerners.<br>
                  <br>
                  Rama discussed at length with D.J.F., his personal caretaker 
                  of five years, the idea of having a website geared towards interesting 
                  the youth of the West in Buddhism. Dr. Frederick Lenz wrote 
                  a two-book sequel which were spiritual adventures about snowboarding 
                  in the Himalayas: &quot;Surfing the Himalayas&quot; and &quot;Snowboarding 
                  to Nirvana.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  This website gives you various &quot;Surfing&quot; options for 
                  your browsing pleasure. We invite all those interested in what 
                  we have to offer here, or could offer here, to send us  
                  feedback...perhaps someone has a Rama adventure, rare photos, session notes or handouts to contribute. 
                  In time, D.J.F. hopes to host a window in which he will share 
                  a new Rama '<i>Rememberance</i>' each month from his time of working 
                  in close proximity to Rama. David was not a &quot;Rama student&quot; 
                  as he had just completed spending ten years with his own enlightened 
                  teacher who then left the body not long before he met and was 
                  employed by Rama.</font><br>
                  <br>
                  <font color="#888888" face="Arial">In the future, we hope to 
                  host a Buddhist Beach Party somewhere in Malibu, CA. D.J.F. would 
                  like to meet with interested students of Buddhism, so that he 
                  might share some of his more fascinating experiences while spending 
                  time and working for the enlightened American Buddhist Master, 
                  Dr. Frederick P. Lenz III, or Rama, as he was known to his students. 
                  Rama's students are eternally grateful that they were able to 
                  spend time and meditate with such a wonderful teacher.</font><br>
